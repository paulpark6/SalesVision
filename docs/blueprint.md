## Core Features:

- Sales Data Input: Allows employees to input sales data with fields for date, product category, product code, description, customer details (name, code, grade), quantity, price (determined by product and customer grade), total price, payment method (cash, check, credit, prepayment, or combinations), associated employee code, and invoice number. Owner can manage sales with and without invoice numbers separately.
- Sales Target Tracking: Allows to set monthly sales target. Displays current month and cumulative month achievement rate and additionally last year data for the same period.

- Product Pricing and Stock Management: Enables admins/owners to upload product prices, monitor stock levels, and observe sales cycles. Prices are owner-defined (imports) or admin-defined (local purchases).
- Sales Trend Analysis: Uses past sales data to identify sales patterns or seasonal trends and present this information in a concise way.
- Secure Data Modification: Implements an authorization system where modification of owner-approved data requires additional clearance or approval.
- Dashboard: Displays panels to enter daily/monthly sales, to display sales target achievements, and highlight any due payments. Provides views for managers to monitor team performance and for owners to oversee overall sales and credit issues.
- Cost and Profit Analysis: Allows monthly upload of cost prices to calculate total cost and revenue, broken down by employee and product. Differentiates between local, import, self-developed, and other-developed customers for commission calculation.
